### Dataset

* The dataset will be generated during experimental analysis. Instructions will be provided.

### Project idea

> Performance modelling of cloud workloads aims to create a computational model to estimate and predict the behavior and performance of an application, such as a transactional system like an e-shop where its database is heavily used for writing or updating data. Other use cases include the analysis of HTTP traffic of web servers for estimating traffic spikes or identifying abnormal executions. This idea also has practical applications in security, such as identifying DDoS attacks. Project back-end features include:
>
> 1. Deployment of a seed application and its associated database. This is called a template application.
>
> 2. Deploy a benchmark workload to emulate traffic or usage in periodic/non-periodic workloads and collect data. 
>
> 3. Modelling datasets with various methods and proactive and reactive real-time signal analysis.
> 4. Develop a custom dashboard using existing tools for monitoring and alerting.
> 5. Develop documentation and critical analysis through comparisons.
